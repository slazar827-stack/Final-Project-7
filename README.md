This project is a C++ application designed to process and analyze a list of produce items from a text file. 
It utilizes a map data structure to store item names and their corresponding quantities, allowing users to interact with the data through a console-based menu. 
The program offers several key features, including searching for a specific item and displaying its quantity, listing all items with their quantities, and generating a histogram to visualize item frequency. 
Upon exiting, the application writes the data to a timestamped output file in .dat format for record-keeping. The code emphasizes modular design, user input handling, and basic data visualization.
